# pos_rss
A simple POS printing application to print out the weather, news and optionally your Monzo balance

## Notes

- The RSS feed XML is designed to be updated with a seperate script, probably running as a cron job
- The Monzo OAuth is non-existant
- This was very hacky and written a long time ago (despite the recent commit date) - going by the XML Tue, 12 Sep 2017 23:47:05 GMT
